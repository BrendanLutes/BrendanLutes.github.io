<h1> Hi, My name is Brendan Lutes! </h1>
<p> I am a 19 year old double major studying at the University of Colorado Boulder.
I am pursuing degrees in both Aerospace Engineering and Vocal Performance.
Below you can find a little bit about my differet hobbies and aspects of my life.

<h3> Music </h3>
  <p> Outside of scholarly music pursuits I am an avid consumer of all types of music, and am working on producing my own music.
    I play piano and guitar (poorly) and am always excited to jam with friends.
  </p>
<h3> Boy Scouts of America </h3>
  <p>
    I am an Eagle Scout from Troop 78, in Boulder CO, and have proudly been park of the scouting community since I was in second grade.
    I love what scouting taught me, and the appreciation for the outdoors it fostered. Some of my favorite trips were to Denali, AK, and to Phillmont in New Mexico.
