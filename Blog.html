                      <h2> Im Not a Blogger - 28 June, 2018 </h1>
                      <p> I have never really thought of myself as a blogger, nor have I really had interest in becoming one, and yet here I am making my own blog. In this day and age when people have interesting thoughts they think are particularly worthy of sharing, they usually write a post that ends up on Facebook, where there is a guaranteed audience, and readers have an easy way of commenting and or responding to the post. But that’s not really my style. Facebook, as it has been pointed out many times, has devolved from a community based sharing platform into a series of politically isolated echo chambers where people can have their opinions validated, and rarely opposed. One never really finds intelligent debate on facebook, only childish banter that never goes anywhere and leaves both sides feeling alienated and more steadfast in their opinion than before. Little debate or changing of minds can be done in a climate like this. My hope with this blog is to express my opinions on things, my thoughts and ideas, and to share them to whoever cares enough about my opinions to come to the site and read them. There is no comment section (unless I can figure out how to code one, which seems like a remote possibility), so there can’t be meaningless online banter. Instead I hope that if someone wants to discuss any of my posts, that they will send me an email where we can discuss our opinions in an adult manner, and hopefully, through calm and civilized discussion, both of us can walk away feeling a little more knowledgeable and a little more wise. But I won’t just share opinions on here. I hope for this blog to help paint a picture of who I am as a person through posts about things that I find fascinating or discoveries in science that blow my mind. In the end this blog is really for myself, so I can keep record of how my thoughts and opinions have changed over time, and see what I have been interested in over the years. If you have a conflicting opinion I would LOVE for you to email me and talk to me about it! No one ever tries to change eachothers minds anymore, and I think that’s a big part of why our politics have become so polarized. I can’t promise that any of my posts are going to be eloquent or sophisticated, but they will be my authentic ideas and opinions, and for now thats all Im looking to share. Welcome to my blog!

                      <h2> Thoughts on Social Media Responsibility </h2>
                      <p> 	The topic of social media has been hot on my mind recently, as it seems also to be on the minds of many americans. With the rise of Donald Trump, fake news, and an increase in extreme media and media scandals, it would only seem fitting for us to begin to take a closer look at where we get our information, and what sources we allow to influence our personal opinions. Upon entering college this question was fresh on my mind; who can I trust to give me clear, unbiased information upon which I can build my own opinions? But the more I researched and the more I began to analyze where I was getting my news from, the more disheartened I became. I found that most of the media I had been consuming, and most of the media my friends consumed and shared on social media was clearly biased, and often failed to present anything that resembled factual presentation of events. I was reading sources that told me what I wanted to hear, and not what I didn’t want to hear. It seemed like to matter where I looked, fake news, and strongly politicalized and biased opinions were everywhere, vastly outnumbering moderate and fact based content. Upon coming to this realization I decided to attempt to “balance” my information intake, reading content from both the right and left to inform my beliefs on hot topics. Though I now find that my opinions are less concrete and I see more shades of grey than black and white, I have also found that my trust in any content I read has decreased. Not only from news sources, but especially from social media. It made me wonder; how has american media declined so much that I feel I can no longer fully trust any new source, and how has this new era of media helped to shape the extremely polarized political climate we now find ourselves in? So far my answer to these questions boil down to two things: disillusionment with modern news media, and the rise of a highly politicized social media.
                    	Our disillusionment with modern new outlets has been a long time coming, but in recent times this change has been even more dramatic as new corporations struggle to keep up with the technology revolution, and the fact that current events are now always at the tips of everyone’s fingertips. When someone can get online to find all the current events, and answers to all the questions they need, why would they turn to mainstream news and cable television? Pew research tells us that around <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/pathways-to-news/">50% of millennials no longer get their news from cable news </a>, instead favoring online sources. Additionally fewer than two in ten adult americans read print newspapers regularly. In order to cope with a decreasing viewership and readership, traditional media sources are trying to get readers attention in any way they can, largely through sensationalization of news topics. This can be seen over and over again in the way that the news portrays things like school shootings, climate change, immigration, and trade wars. This is a huge issue as sensational continent is always more likely to be misleading, biased, and rarely stays true to telling the whole story. As mainstream media becomes more and more sensational, its viewers become more and more polarized towards their beliefs, in the truest form of confirmation bias. Biased news outlets paint the other side as liars and as uncredible, further dividing the public and discrediting news media as a whole. When news corporations say that all the content produced by everyone else is likely to be false and biased, it begins to feed the idea that no news source is able to be trusted. When we can’t trust our conventional news media, who then do we trust? Often people turn to social media.
                    	Social media has already been criticized wildly for being comprised largely of echo chambers; your group of friends and those you keep up with on social media are likely to share the same political opinions as you have. Additionally those who don’t agree with your opinion are likely to keep quiet about their disagreement given the stigma around pointless facebook arguing. Though I agree that most of the political fighting that happens on facebook quickly devolves into name calling and huge generalizations there is still something very wrong with a media platform where our ideas are not challenged and are only supported. This again adds to the confirmation bias that has been plaguing our political climate: we believe in our own opinions more and more firmly the more others agree with us. This can be a huge problem when we take into consideration how often our initial opinions are ill informed and not based on facts. Cognitive scientists
                      <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds">Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach </a> discuss a principle they call illusion of explanatory depth, which can basically be boiled down to the idea that we often know a lot less about a topic than we think we do. When asked to explain how simple household objects like toilets and zippers function, people who had said they had a strong understanding of their operation could often describe what they were capable of doing, but could rarely describe how they could do it. Very few people fully understand how a zipper zips, or how a toilet flushes, only that they do flush, and they do zip. This overconfidence they found, was linked to the fact that as a society we rely on the expertise of others to create things that I can operate easily. This leads to a blurring of a line between what I fully know and understand, and what others know and fully understand. This isn’t an issue when discussing the function of zippers, but is a huge issue when discussing politics, as people's beliefs in their knowledge of a political topic are often as unfounded as their belief in the knowledge of how a toilet flushes. Sloman and Fernbach were able to show that the less someone fully understood the intricacies of a subject, the more likely they were to have a strong opinion on the matter. This is where politics on social media becomes even more concerning. Because social media is so widespread, and because of democratic society’s fundamental belief in free speech, we have created a social climate where anyone can share their opinions on a topic with their friends, regardless of how factual or based in reality their opinion is. Much of the political content circulating on Facebook and Twitter (and often much of the content produced by our government and the Trump administration in particular) is not supported by data or facts, and is sometimes outright fabricated. We have vast amounts of information floating around on the internet that is completely, verifiably, and objectively false. This problem is again compounded by the issue of sensationalism which leads the most interesting stories, not necessarily the most factual stories to be shared. This is an interesting problem unique to social media. The media output of most major news sources is heavily vetted by the companies editor in chief, who is both morally and legally held responsible for the type of information that their company proveys. If a company runs a story that is not factual, or is overly sensational, they can be held legally responsible, and can be charged with libel or slander. Social media allows everyone to be their own editor in chief, but with the hugely important distinction that no one (except in extreme circumstances) can be held legally responsible for the content they share and spread online. After all, everyone has the right to free speech, right? Even more concerning is research that has been done by the Media Insight Project, which seeks to understand how media is processed and what sources are perceived as trustworthy. They have found that more than the source of media, people look towards the disseminator of the media to determine if it is trustworthy or not. They conducted an experiment where people were given media from trusted and untrusted sources, that were shared by trusted and untrusted friends and sharrers. “The results illustrate that people who saw the article from a trusted sharer and unknown media source have much more positive opinions of the article than those who saw the story from a distrusted sharer and reputable news source.” <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/trust-social-media/"> American Press </a>
                      The addition of this fact to an already concerning politicized social media platform paints a grim picture. Political media on social platforms is often not based in truth, is disseminated by those who are uneducated on the topic, and is then given credibility by those who share it, leading to echo chambers filled with agreeing, but erroneous ideas and beliefs. These false ideas lead to stronger and more polarized political beliefs and a more hostile political climate in which little rational discussion can occur.
                      What am I really trying to get at? I guess it would be this: if we want to create a more open political discourse, and desire solutions to the extremely complex issues that face us today we need to take more responsibility for the media we consume and share. Read more news papers, watch less cable news, and share less political information on social media. Instead of ignoring an opposing belief, try to understand it, and get others to understand your viewpoint. More than anything understand, as I am quickly coming to understand, that any one person doesn't have all the answers and we often know a lot less than we like to believe. I can’t claim to be able to do any of this yet, but I am sure going to try, and at the end of the day that’s all anyone can really do.
