                      <h2> Im Not a Blogger - 28 June, 2018 </h1>
                      <p> I have never really thought of myself as a blogger, nor have I really had interest in becoming one, and yet here I am making my own blog. In this day and age when people have interesting thoughts they think are particularly worthy of sharing, they usually write a post that ends up on Facebook, where there is a guaranteed audience, and readers have an easy way of commenting and or responding to the post. But that’s not really my style. Facebook, as it has been pointed out many times, has devolved from a community based sharing platform into a series of politically isolated echo chambers where people can have their opinions validated, and rarely opposed. One never really finds intelligent debate on facebook, only childish banter that never goes anywhere and leaves both sides feeling alienated and more steadfast in their opinion than before. Little debate or changing of minds can be done in a climate like this. My hope with this blog is to express my opinions on things, my thoughts and ideas, and to share them to whoever cares enough about my opinions to come to the site and read them. There is no comment section (unless I can figure out how to code one, which seems like a remote possibility), so there can’t be meaningless online banter. Instead I hope that if someone wants to discuss any of my posts, that they will send me an email where we can discuss our opinions in an adult manner, and hopefully, through calm and civilized discussion, both of us can walk away feeling a little more knowledgeable and a little more wise. But I won’t just share opinions on here. I hope for this blog to help paint a picture of who I am as a person through posts about things that I find fascinating or discoveries in science that blow my mind. In the end this blog is really for myself, so I can keep record of how my thoughts and opinions have changed over time, and see what I have been interested in over the years. If you have a conflicting opinion I would LOVE for you to email me and talk to me about it! No one ever tries to change eachothers minds anymore, and I think that’s a big part of why our politics have become so polarized. I can’t promise that any of my posts are going to be eloquent or sophisticated, but they will be my authentic ideas and opinions, and for now thats all Im looking to share. Welcome to my blog!
