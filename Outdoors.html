     <h1> The Great Ourdoors</h1>
       <p> As a native of Boulder Colorado, I am rarely happier than when I am exploring the ourdoors with friends!
       <h3> Boy Scouts of America</h3>
         <p> I have been a Boy Scout since 2006, learning about leadership, teamwork, and the outdoors. In 2016 I proudly became the 149th Eagle Scout in Troop 78, from Boulder CO.
         In order to become an eagle scout I completed hundreds of requirements, went out countless camping trips, and held a number of leadership positions. During my time in Troop 78 I went on a number of high adventures
       including trips to Phillmont Scout Ranch, the Boundary Waters of Canada, Florida Sea Base, and Denali Alaska. Below you can find pictures from my time in Scouting</p>

       <h3> Outdoor Ethics and Responsibility </h3>
        <p> Part of enjoying the ourdoors, is being responsible stewards of the natural resources and lands were have been given.
          This is not only a fundamental part of scouting, and my scouting education, but is one of my fundamental beliefs.
          As such, and especially in the current political climate of today, below are some resources to educate yourself, and contribute to wildlife conservation funds.
          Also included are links to climate change resources, as fighting climate change is an essential part to preserving our outdoors.
