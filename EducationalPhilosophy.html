  <h1>Educational Philosophy </h1>
    <p>
        I believe that everyone who wishes to better themselves should seek some form of education every single day. A higher education is an opportunity to shed light onto new ways of thinking, to grow ones knowledge base, and to arm oneself with the tools for success later in life. It is also one of my core beliefs that you should always, to the extent possible, do what you love. This notion is slightly idealistic, but the goal of pursuing material and a livelihood that keeps you interested and motivated to continue to do good work, is of paramount importance.

  	    In this light I began my tertiary education by pursuing a double major in the two things that I loved the most: music and science. This choice of two highly contrasting majors is often met with questioning and criticism. “How do you plan to combine these two career paths?” and “Doesnt music just distract from your engineering work?” are questions I have often received. My answer is always the same: I have no clue! But I am pursuing the things that I love, and every day I get to learn and grow as a student of multiple disciplines. I simply have faith that one day I will be able to combine the skill sets into an atypical, yet personally meaningful career and life.

        My college schedule is always packed full of classes and my days are always a little bit hectic and frantic, but I am always doing what I love. I often find that switching mentalities in between classes, moving from music to engineering, actually helps me focus on the task I am currently working on, and helps to foster greater creativity in my daily thinking. In music classes I will be able to apply a recently learned engineering principle to help my mastery of music theory, and I will be able to apply the creativity and free thinking of music to help me get past tough engineering problems. I find that the crossover between music and engineering is larger than most people would expect, and that having both swirling around in my head all the time helps me conquer problems I might not have had the confidence and willingness to approach otherwise.

        Education however is more than just classes and tests. Education can apply to everyday living just as easily as it does school. In this vein I would say that I place great value in the education of the outdoors and travel. As an Eagle Scout and outdoorsman I constantly find growth and development in the outdoors. This can take the shape of leadership training while camping, environmental consciousness in the outdoors, or even just learning what it means to sleep without the comforts of home for a brief time. I love to travel, and the varied experiences, and lifestyle differences I experience while traveling abroad are invaluable to my overall education.

    Education also takes the form of other activities done on a weekly basis after classes finish for the day. Working a job or joining a group like Engineers Without Borders can give you as many hands on learning experiences as coursework can. Alternatively I find that simply conversing with one's peers can be extremely educational. Friends are a great way to consider the world through other people's viewpoints, and to learn to be less guarded and more thoughtful. I know that I have learnt more about how to be a good person from my friends than from any other source, and I continue to learn every day.
    </P>
  <p>
    The reality is, that education can be found everywhere as long as you look hard enough. I approach every day, as best as I can, in a learning mentality, because we are never finished growing and never finished becoming a better person, so long as we continue trying to learn.
